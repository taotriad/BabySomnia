# BOCA: Hints and details to look out for

The Dystopia trilogy deals with cyber-bullying. The three songs
represent Hear No Evil (ðŸ™‰), Speak No Evil (ðŸ™Š), and See No Evil (ðŸ™ˆ).

BOCA represents Speak No Evil (ðŸ™Š).

The "too many angels dying" part of the lyrics (most likely) refers to two idols, Sulli from f(x) and Goo Hara from Kara,
who committed suicide just a few months before the release of Scream.

BOCA means "Mouth" in Spanish & Portuguese.

## Notes

* Handong is missing in this video, due to participating in Youth With You, a talent show in China and subsequently getting stuck in Wuhan due to Covid-19 travel restrictions.
* There is no substitute dancer for Handong in this video.
* Currently (2024-10-11), BOCA is by far the most watched Dreamcatcher music video, with 77M views.
  Part of this might be attributed to Dami's rap going viral.
