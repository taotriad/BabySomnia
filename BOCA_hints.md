# BOCA: Hints and details to look out for

The Dystopia trilogy deals with cyber-bullying. The three songs represent the Hear No Evil/Speak No Evil/See No Evil.
BOCA represents Speak No Evil. The "too many angels dying" (most likely) refers to two idols (Sulli from f(x) and Goo Hara from Kara)
who committed suicide just a few months before the release of Scream.

BOCA means "Mouth" in Spanish & Portuguese.

Currently (2024-10-01), BOCA is by far the most watched Dreamcatcher music video, with 77M views.

*Note*: Handong is missing in this video, due to participating in Youth With You, a talent show in China and subsequently getting stuck in Wuhan due to Covid-19 travel restrictions.  
*Note*: There is no substitute dancer for Handong in this video.
