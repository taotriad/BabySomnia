# Endless Night: Guide with spoilers!

The lyrics is about their career, starting from the Minx era.
When they realised Minx was a failure. The struggle, the tears,
the sleepless nights, thinking this was the end of their career.

How it suddenly became a beginning instead. How failure is
something to learn from.

Don't listen to the naysayers. Don't look back. Aim for the top!
