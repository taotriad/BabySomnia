# Basic facts about Dreamcatcher

* The group has 7 members. In a few of the videos there are only 6 members (possibly with some additional background dancers); this is because one of the members was in China when Covid-19 hit and wasn't allowed back to South Korea for one year.
  The comeback for Justice in summer 2024 had the main vocalist Siyeon missing, but only during promotions. The music video and a few other videos has 7 members, but the showcases only have 6 members.
* The group was formed in 2017[^](A_brief_history_of_Minx.md).
* Most of their title tracks are pop/rock with other influences mixed in.
* Almost all their songs are composed by the same duo; **Ollounder** (Oh Jong Hoon) & **Leez** (Lee Soo Min).
* Leez left the company in 2022 when offered an exclusive contract with Hi-Hat Co., Ltd as music director.
* Rock isn't very popular in South Korea, at least partially related to the "Rux scandal". Feel free to read about it, but watching any videos you might find is not recommended.
* Their company used to be called Happy Face Entertainment (HFE; logotype: a red smiling face). Nowadays it's called Dreamcatcher Company (DCC).
* The official fan club is called InSomnia.
* InSomnia has a reputation for being helpful (and thankful!) towards reactors and welcoming towards newcomers. This guide aims to continue that tradition.
* The leader of Dreamcatcher, JiU, has said that she would want to collaborate with all girl groups. It stands to reason that any good InSomnia should behave well towards other fandoms.

## About the members

Just like most K-pop bands the members change outfits, hairstyles,
contact lenses, hair colours, makeup, etc. between almost every performance.
Partially because the different TV-shows demand that the performers
look different outfits than on the competitors shows.
Due to thus it's pointless to describe them by hair colour, eye colour, style, etc.,
except in the context of a particular performance.

It can be tricky to tell some of the members apart. Don't worry, it happens to all of us.
Recognition will come with time.

### The members are (ordered by age)

* **JiU** (Kim Min-ji); [Jee-yoo]. Leader, lead vocalist, lead dancer. Born 1994. Calls herself Charisma rabbit (sometimes also Pink Princess). Animal: rabbit (üê∞)
* **SuA** (Kim Bo-ra) [Soo-ah]. Main dancer, vocalist. Used to be lead rapper. Born 1994. Calls herself Queen SuA. Animal: crow-tit (üê•)
* **Siyeon** (Lee Si-yeon) [She-yawn]. Main vocalist. Born 1995. Calls herself Wolfie (due to her intense stare on stage). Animal: wolf (üê∫)
* **Handong** (Han Dong) [Hahn-dong]. Vocalist. Born 1996. Chinese. Calls herself Ice Princess. Animal: cat (üê±)
* **Yoohyeon** (Kim Yoo-hyeon) [Yoo-hyawn]. Lead vocalist. Born 1997. Animal: dog (üê∂)
* **Dami** (Lee Yu-bin) [Dah-mee]. Main rapper, lead dancer. Born 1997. Calls herself panda. Animal: panda (üêº)
* **Gahyun** (Lee Ga-hyun) [Kah-hyawn]. Lead rapper, vocalist. Born 1999. Animal: fox (ü¶ä)

*Note:* Material prior to July 2024 has Gahyun\'s name romanised as Gahyeon; this was done by the agency in an effort to pair her name with Yoohyeon.  
*Note:* Handong often refers to herself as Dongie or Dong Dong. For a non-native speaker Dong Dong might be a bad idea to use, since there's a Korean
word that sounds similar that means poop. Handong herself has pronounced her own name wrong a lot of times, with hilarious results.

## Dorm life

* Initially JiU, Siyeon, and Dami shared a dorm room; JiU & Siyeon shared a bunk bed (JiU top bunk, Siyeon bottom bunk), Dami had a separate bed.
  SuA and Yoohyeon had the second room (Yoohyeon top bunk, SuA bottom bunk). Handong and Gahyun had the third room (Handong top bunk, Gahyun bottom bunk). One of their managers stayed in the fourth room.
* Sometime in 2020 the manager moved out and Dami got that room to herself; JiU and Siyeon got their own beds.
* A lot of their vlives, especially during Covid-19, were either recorded in the lower bunks in their rooms, directly on the floor with the camera facing their closets, or in the hallway in the closet area.
* For a long, long time their dorm didn't have a sofa. When watching TV they were either sitting on the floor or on a gigantic (Dami-sized) teddy bear that they got early on from a fan.
* It seems that spring 2022 is the last time any of the members did vlives from anything resembling their old dorm. There have also been some vague statements alluding to them having their own place.
  They still do joint vlives from time to time, but they're recorded at their office. It is speculated that they've moved to either to their own places,
  or a new dorm. Most likely getting their own places or a new dorm was part of the renewed contract. Either way they are unlikely to disclose anything about new location(s) due to the the increase in sasaengs.
