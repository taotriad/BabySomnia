# Basic facts about Dreamcatcher

* The group has 7 members. In a few of the videos there are only 6 members (possibly with some additional background dancers); this is because one of the members was in China when Covid hit and wasn't allowed back to South Korea for one year.
  The comeback for Justice in summer 2024 had the main vocalist missing, but only during promotions; the music video and some other videos will have 7 members, but the showcases only have 6 members.
* The group was formed in 2017[^](A_brief_history_of_Minx.md).
* Most of their title tracks are pop/rock with other influences mixed in.
* Almost all their songs are composed by the same duo; Ollounder & Leez.
* Leez left the company in 2022 when offered an exclusive contract with Hi-Hat Co., Ltd as music director.
* Rock isn't very popular in South Korea, at least partially related to the "Rux scandal".
* Their company used to be called Happy Face Entertainment (HFE; logotype: a red smiling face). Nowadays it's called Dreamcatcher Company (DCC).
* The official fanclub is called InSomnia.
* InSomnia has a reputation for being helpful (and thankful!) towards reactors.  This guide is my attempt to do my part.
* The leader of Dreamcatcher, JiU, has said that she'd want to collab with all girl groups. It stands to reason that any good InSomnia should behave well towards other fandoms.

Just like most Kpop bands the members change outfits, hairstyles,
contact lenses, hair colours, makeup, etc. between almost every comeback, thus it's pointless
to describe them by hair colour, eye colour, style, etc..

It can be tricky to tell some of the members apart. Don't worry, it happens to all of us.
