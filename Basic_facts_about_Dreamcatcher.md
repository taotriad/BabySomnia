# Basic facts about Dreamcatcher

* The group has 7 members. In a few of the videos there are only 6 members (possibly with some additional background dancers); this is because one of the members was in China when Covid hit and wasn't allowed back to South Korea for one year.
  The comeback for Justice in summer 2024 had the main vocalist Siyeon missing, but only during promotions. The music video and a few other videos has 7 members, but the showcases only have 6 members.
* The group was formed in 2017[^](A_brief_history_of_Minx.md).
* Most of their title tracks are pop/rock with other influences mixed in.
* Almost all their songs are composed by the same duo; Ollounder & Leez.
* Leez left the company in 2022 when offered an exclusive contract with Hi-Hat Co., Ltd as music director.
* Rock isn't very popular in South Korea, at least partially related to the "Rux scandal". I suggest reading about it, but not watching any videos you might find.
* Their company used to be called Happy Face Entertainment (HFE; logotype: a red smiling face). Nowadays it's called Dreamcatcher Company (DCC).
* The official fanclub is called InSomnia.
* InSomnia has a reputation for being helpful (and thankful!) towards reactors and welcoming towards newcomers. This guide aims to continue that tradition.
* The leader of Dreamcatcher, JiU, has said that she would want to collab with all girl groups. It stands to reason that any good InSomnia should behave well towards other fandoms.

## About the members

Just like most Kpop bands the members change outfits, hairstyles,
contact lenses, hair colours, makeup, etc. between almost every performance.
Partially because the different TV-shows demand that the performers
look different outfits than on the competitors shows.
Due to thus it's pointless to describe them by hair colour, eye colour, style, etc.,
except in the context of a particular performance.

It can be tricky to tell some of the members apart. Don't worry, it happens to all of us.
Recognition will come with time.

## Dorm life

* Initially JiU, Siyeon, and Dami shared a dorm room; JiU & Siyeon shared a bunk bed (JiU top bunk, Siyeon bottom bunk), Dami had a separate bed.
  SuA and Yoohyeon had the second room (Yoohyeon top bunk, SuA bottom bunk). Handong and Gahyun had the third room (Handong top bunk, Gahyun bottom bunk). One of their managers stayed in the fourth room.
* Sometime in 2020 the manager moved out and Dami got that room to herself; JiU and Siyeon got their own beds.
* A lot of their vlives are either recorded in the lower bunks in their rooms, directly on the floor with the camera facing their closets, or in the hallway in the closet area.
* For a long, long time their dorm didn't have a sofa. When watching TV they were either sitting on the floor or on a gigantic (Dami-sized) teddy bear that they got early on from a fan.
