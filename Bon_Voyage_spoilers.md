# Bon Voyage: Guide with spoilers!

While singing "I love you" Yoohyeon also signs "I L Y" in sign language.

The fluffy thing is a cell; the group has given it the name [Celly](https://dreamcatcher.fandom.com/wiki/Celly).
A cell that will restore life on Earth while mankind is shielded away.

The video ends when Gahyun lowers the shield. The planet has recovered
to a point where it might be possible for humans to once more populate
the planet, hopefully this time without destroying it.

## Notes

* Since several reactors have been confused by the scene with Siyeon and SuA,
  it's worth clarifying that Siyeon is using her powers to shield SuA;
  she is **not** attacking SuA.
