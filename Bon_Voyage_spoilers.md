# Bon Voyage: Guide with spoilers!

While singing "I love you" Yoohyeon also signs "I L Y" in sign language.

The fluffy thing is a cell; the group has given it the name [Celly](https://dreamcatcher.fandom.com/wiki/Celly).
A cell that will restore life on Earth while mankind is shielded away.

The tarot card that Gahyun holds is the Six of Swords.
We see it in both configurations; upright and reversed.
Upright it symbolises transitioning, leaving something behind, moving on,
while the reversed version symbolises lack of progress and a reluctance
to act; hesitating even though change is needed.

In the video we see several butterflies. Butterflies have been seen
in several other Dreamcatcher music videos. In those they've been
interpreted as representations of the soul. Seeing as this video is
about how the planet might go on without manking this could mean
that they represent the same thing here.

Near the end we see 3 Dami's with 7 shadows. The shadows most likely represent
the 7 members, but why 3 Dami? No idea...

The video ends when Gahyun lowers the shield. The planet has recovered
to a point where it might be possible for humans to once more populate
the planet, hopefully this time without destroying it.

## Notes

* Since several reactors have been confused by the scene with Siyeon and SuA,
  it's worth clarifying that Siyeon is using her powers to shield SuA;
  she is **not** attacking SuA. On the contrary, Siyeon walking alone
  in the [Escher-esque landscape](https://mcescher.com/gallery/impossible-constructions/)
  and sitting alone in the car indicates that she might've sacrificed herself to save SuA.
