# Red Sun: Hints and details to look out for

The song is about hypnotism. The term Red Sun originates from Kim Yeong-Guk;
a charlatan who supposedly hypnotised people in TV performances.
Red Sun was his "trigger phrase".

This also explains the hypnotic mood of both the song and the video, and the snap.

## Notes

* The album version and the music video were created during Handong's absence. The Webtoon Singer version is recordeed with Handong present.
* In the rearranged version of the song the snap sound has been replaced with a drip sound, representing dripping blood.
* The Webtoon Singer version represented the webtoon [Unholy Blood](https://koreanwebtoons.fandom.com/wiki/Unholy_Blood) by [Lina Im](https://www.instagram.com/llina_fs/);
  Lina Im can be spotted several times during their performance. She also drew [charicatures of Dreamcatcher](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cqc4JGurK54/).
* The term Red Sun is very popular in Korean pop culture. Several other K-pop groups have songs named Red Sun; at the very least
  [Hangzoo: Red Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luQwXvSR22g), [Viviz: Red Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eis2adovqfI), and [GWSN: Red Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRXqf7mBJtY).
