# K-pop terminology primer

* **7-year curse**: Most idols sign contracts that run for 7 years from
  debut (unless their group is disbanded before that). The 7-year curse
  refers to the fact that most groups don't make it past year 7 because
  some of the group members tend to want a solo career, other wants to
  quit entirely, etc.
* **Aegyo**: Extremely cute behaviour. Described by Sunny of
  [Girls' Generation (aka SNSD)](https://girls-generation.fandom.com/wiki/Girls%27_Generation),
  one of the most famous K-pop groups ever, as "cuteness that calls for a punch".
* **Album**: Typically more songs than a mini album...
* **Boy Group**: Not unsurprisingly an idol group with only boys.
  Maybe the most famous example is [BTS](https://bts.fandom.com/wiki/BTS_Wiki).
* **Coed Group**: A group with a mix of boys and girls. Very rare.
  Since these groups are rare, and since they are friends with **Dreamcatcher**,
  I'll give [KARD](https://kard.fandom.com/wiki/KARD) as an example.
* **Concept**: The theme that the band wants to project. Most bands tend to
  follow trends and change concept almost every comeback.
* **Comeback**: Any subsequent release after the debut. Unlike Western terminology where
  the term tends to imply that the artist has been inactive during an
  extended period of time in-between releases, in K-pop the term
  simply means a new release.
* **Debut**: An idol's or group's first official release.
* **Disbandment**: Typically describes when the company that an idol
  group belongs to decides that the group no longer deserves to continue
  existing.
* **Gen(eration)**: K-pop groups tend to be lumped into generations.
  Different sources have different ranges for the years and what groups
  belong to which generation. As of 2024 there doesn't even seem to be full
  agreement about whether we're at the end of 4th gen or the beginning
  of 5th gen. One way or the other, **Dalâ˜…Shabet** is generally regarded as
  late 2nd gen, **Minx** as middle 3rd gen, and **Dreamcatcher** as late 3rd gen.
* **Eonnie**: Older sister (if you're female).
* **Fancam**: An unofficial recording of a performance or other type of event.
  Often, but not always, focuses on one single member of a group.
  Some **music shows** also release what they call fancams; in those cases
  it's official videos, but focusing on one single member. This means that from
  music shows with Dreamcatcher there might be 8-9 recordings of the same performance.
  The "regular" recording, a from high-up recording, and 7 fancams.
* **Girl Group**: An idol group with only girls. Duh. The best example is *obviously*
  **Dreamcatcher**. ðŸ¤©
* **Mini album**: Typically more songs than than a single album...
* **Mukbang (ë¨¹ë°©)**: Food related content.  See also **Sulbang**.
* **Music show**: Traditionally new releases are promoted at music
  shows. Based on an aggregate of public votes, sales, streaming
  figures, etc. the shows will then present their weekly winners.
  Different shows calculate their scores in different ways; due to this
  smaller groups like **Dreamcatcher** generally only has a shot to win
  at a small subset of the shows.
* **Noona**: Older sister (if you're male).
* **Nuna**: Alternative spelling of Noona.
* **OST**: Original Soundtrack. Music made for a movie, TV-series, game, or similar.
* **Promotion**: The period after a comeback during which the idol or
  idol group promotes their new release.
* **The Big 3**: the biggest 3 companies. Recently this was expanded to The Big 4.
* **The Big 4**: the biggest 4 companies. They have vastly more resources to
  spend on marketing, choreographers, song writers, etc., and often have
  connections with both the Music Shows and with other shows where the
  idols and idol groups typically promote.
* **Re-debut**: A very rare occurrence, where an idol or group is given a
  "second life" by making another debut in a different group, or with
  a new group name. This typically involves changing concept too.
* **Resign**: Confusingly enough the term resign in K-pop terms refers
  to renewing a contract (re-sign), not quitting. A group that resigns
  (renews their contract) generally is considered to have survived
  the 7-year curse.
* **Rux**: A Korean punk/rock band who invited some friends on stage
  during a live TV performance. Those friends decided to show off a bit too
  much of their intimates; it took a few seconds for the producers to cut
  the live feed. The TV show ended up being cancelled and people were arrested.
  Ever since then rock music has had a bad reputation in Korea.
* **Sasaeng**: A stalker or person who buys and sells private
  information about idols.
* **Single album**: Typically not just one song...
* **Stan**: A fan.
* **Subunit**: A subset of an idol group.
* **Sulbang (ìˆ ë°©)**: (Sometimes romanised as Soolbang). Like a Mukbang,
  but with both food and alcohol.
* **Sunbaenim**: Senior at a workplace; in the context of K-pop this
  is an idol or group that debuted before yours.
* **Unnie**: Alternative romanisation of eonnie.
* **Win**: Typically refers to winning the trophy at a weekly music show.
  A music show win is considered a *hugely* important milestone in the career
  of an idol or idol group; groups that repeatedly fail to a get a win tend to
  get disbanded by their company.  Going a long time without a win is
  often a major cause of stress for idols.
* **Yaja Time**: Time when juniors are permitted to speak informal to their seniors.
  Typically only used between friends or siblings.

## Group positions

* **Dancer (Lead)**: The front line dancers behind the main dancer.
* **Dancer (Main)**: The best dancer in the group. Often expected to be able
  to help the rest of the members learn their choreography
  (since choreographers' time is money). Often have solo dance parts.
* **Dancer**: The remaining dancers.
* **Leader**: Hopefully self-explanatory. Often, but not always,
  either the oldest or the first recruited member of a group.
  Several groups have changed their leader over time, for a variety of reasons.
  The leader changing careers or going solo is one reason. Another is if the company
  or the members lose their trust in the leader's ability to lead
  or motivate the members.
* **Maknae**: The youngest member of an idol group. Often expected to be cutesy;
  see **Aegyo**.
* **Rapper (Lead)**: If the group has more than one rapper they tend to be
  titled lead rappers analogous to lead vocalists.
* **Rapper (Main)**: Reflecting the position of the main vocalist the main
  rapper does most of the rapping; many groups have only one rapper,
  some does not have any rapper at all. Rappers often participate
  in writing their own lyrics. Rappers often have different choreography
  than the other members during their raps; sometimes the rest of the
  members will stand aside completely during the rap.
* **Rapper (Sub)**: Slightly less common than sub vocalist;
  typically a better rapper than non-rapping members. Often referred to
  as just rapper.
* **Visual**: The member of an idol group that most closely resembles Korean
  beauty standards.
* **Vocalist (Lead)**: All-round singers that typically does bridges or
  verses; groups with several vocalists typically have more than one
  lead vocalist.
* **Vocalist (Main)**: Unlike typical Western terminology the #1 vocalist
  in a K-pop group is referred to as the main vocalist, *not* lead vocalist.
  The main vocalist often does high notes, belts, vocal runs, the higher part of
  harmonies, ad libs, and tends to be the member who first gets to do a
  solo debut. Usually groups only have one main vocalist.
  Due to their often more heavy load they sometimes break formation
  while the rest of the group is dancing, to ensure full breath control
  during intense belts, high notes, etc.
* **Vocalist (Sub)**: Vocalists that either have a narrower scope
  as vocalists due to the range or colour of their voice, or because
  they have other tasks in the group (for instance a main dancer might
  not be expected to also do lead vocalist duties). Sometimes referred
  to as just vocalist.
