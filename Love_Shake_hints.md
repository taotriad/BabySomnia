# Love Shake: Hints and details to look out for

This was not an original song; it is a B-side from the album [Bang Bang](https://dalshabet.fandom.com/wiki/Bang_Bang)
by Dalâ˜…Shabet, Minx' sunbaenims at Happyface Entertainment.

Minx' first single [Why Did You Come to My Home?](Why_Did_You_Come_to_My_Home_hints.md) came out in 2014.
Love Shake was released one year later. 2 underage members, still plenty of questionable outfits and camera angles.
A borrowed song and a low budget music video. The single sold less than 4000 copies.
Meanwhile competition got even more intense from newly debuted groups.

It's probably not all that surprising that they didn't have much success.
Considering that the failure of Minx eventually led to the birth of Dreamcatcher
one might say that it was kind of lucky.
