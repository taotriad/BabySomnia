# Love Shake: Hints and details to look out for

This was actually not an original song; it's a B-side from Minx' sunbaenims at Happyface Entertainment, Dalâ˜…Shabet.

One year later. 2 underage members, still plenty of questionable outfits and camera angles.
A borrowed song and a low budget music video. The single sold less than 4000 copies.
Meanwhile competition got even more intense from newly debuted groups.

It's probably not all that surprising that they didn't have much success.
Considering that the failure of Minx eventually led to the birth of Dreamcatcher
one might say that it was kind of lucky.
