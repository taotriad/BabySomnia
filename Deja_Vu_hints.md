# Deja Vu: Hints and details to look out for

The music video contains two different versions of the same events; only one of them is real.
The music video is a tie-in to a mobile game called King's Raid. Playing the game is,
however, not necessary to enjoy the music video.

Dreamcatcher also made an opening song (Eclipse) for the anime King's Raid: Successors of the Will.
