# You and I: Hints and details to look out for

The spinning top on the floor that JiU finds is apparently a reference to a similar item in the movie [Inception](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/)
which is used to tell dream from reality. In dreams it spins indefinitely, while in reality it stops after a while.
