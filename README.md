# Welcome to BabySomnia!

## Introduction

This guide is aimed at people who just stumbled upon Dreamcatcher,
people who have been told that they *should* stumble upon Dreamcatcher,
people who have been requested to react to Dreamcatcher, etc.

The guide makes the assumption that you have a fairly limited, or
non-existing, exposure to Dreamcatcher, or at least to their music
videos and history. Having heard their music without seeing the videos
is OK. Having seen random tiktok clips or other clips also won't
interfere with the general flow outlined here.

If you're planning to react to Dreamcatcher's music videos,
you should be aware that all Dreamcatcher main title videos
have a deeper meaning.

Therefore there all main titles will have two links attached;
one to **[H]** ints and details to look out for.
One to comments that contain **[S]** poilers.

Furthermore a lot of the main titles are grouped into storylines.
The storylines are introduced in the first title of the series.

You can use the checklist as a reference when figuring out
what information in the guide is relevant to your particular
interests.

**[0]** Are you completely new to K-pop?  
**[1]** Are you planning to do reaction videos?  
**[2]** Do you like rock music?  
**[3]** Did you find out about Dreamcatcher through random weird clips?  
**[4]** Do you like watching choreography videos?  
**[5]** Are you attracted to women?  
**[6]** Do you want the backstory of the group?  
**[7]** Are you interested in covers?  
**[8]** Are you interested solo songs and/or subunits?  
**[9]** Do you like food related videos?  

For of the titles before there are multiple video links.
One will always be the primary music video (if any). The remaining links
are typically performances with a live band, self-made music videos, etc.
Videos that are primarily dance focused are tagged with **[4]**,
if they're primarily goofy they're tagged with **[3]**.

Extra material that is recommended for every everyone are tagged with **[A]**.
Extra material that complements an era is tagged with **[X]**.
There will be no specific tags for people who want to get to know
Dreamcatcher in general; for music just think of yourself as a reactor.

## [1] Things to keep in mind when doing reaction videos

If you plan to react to their music, here are a few things to keep in mind:

* Since the Dreamcatcher music videos are story heavy, most reactors seem to have a difficult time focusing on lyrics, music, and music video at the same time; 2 viewings might be a good idea, or just listening to the song first without the video.
* Don't spend too much effort on trying to tell the members apart at first. That'll come with experience.
* Finding correct lyrics videos, especially with correct line distribution, is tricky.
* Most of their official music videos have subtitles. A few of them have subtitles that are prefixed with the name of the vocalist/rapper performing the current line, which is helpful to get to recognise the members.
* While it might be tempting to skip around randomly, Dreamcatcher's songs are grouped into themes; the music videos, and to some degree also the lyrics, are connected. Watching MVs within an era in the wrong order will be confusing.
* **Dreamcatcher Company** does not seem to file copyright claims on YouTube. Japanese labels are typically stricter about copyright, but there enough reactions to Dreamcatcher's Japanese releases to indicate this might not be an issue in Dreamcatcher's case.
* **Music Shows** are *very* eager to file copyright claims. Some really good, and historically important, material is likely to be tricky to react to. My suggestion is to ask other reactors about their experience.

## [2] Rock music

If you do **NOT** like rock/metal music at all, some of their music *might* be
a hard sell (that said, a lot of people who say that they don't like
rock still seem to appreciate Dreamcatcher, especially when starting
with some of the less "rocky" songs). At the very least there are a
*lot* of B-sides that you might enjoy.

If you *only* like rock/metal there are very few songs that are likely
to fully satisfy; their Japanese tracks are your best bet. That said,
most rockers and metal heads that have listened to Dreamcatcher have
found it quite appealing. You're probably here because you're curious at
least?

## [3] Random clips

If you came in contact with Dreamcatcher through watching random clips,
and *completely* lack interest in anything music related, there's still
a whole world of weird and fun stuff to watch. That said, if you didn't
also check **[9]** the list of material will decrease quite dramatically.

Videos tagged **[3][4]** have very amusing choreography that likely to
entertain even though they are centered around music & choreography.

## [4] Choreography videos

Dreamcatcher's music videos tend to be story driven and contain fairly
limited amount of choreo, but they still create full choreographies to
all their title tracks (and quite a few of their B-sides as well).
The group is quite famous for physically demanding and complex choreography.
If you're in it for the choreo, make sure to watch relay dance videos,
dance rehearsals, showcase videos, etc.

I'll try to mention extra noteworthy examples (and why they're noteworthy).

There are also a few videos made by their choreographer, explaining the
thoughts behind the choreography. If you are a fan of choreography,
those videos will probably be highly interesting.

## [5] Attracted to women?

The easy way out is to say that pretty much all of their material is
suitable if you just want to watch beautiful women. But there is
definitely some material that's a bit more sexy than others. The kind
of videos you probably don't mind watching with friends or your partner,
but definitely wouldn't watch together with your parents or
grandparents.

## [6] Backstory

There are several good video guides about the band. My two favourite
guides contain MV spoilers though, so their place in the order of videos
are determined by avoidance of spoilers.

## [7][8] Covers and Solos/Subunits

These will be in the section Recommended Viewing.

## [9] Food related videos (mukbang)

Dreamcatcher eat and/or talk about food quite a lot in their behind the scenes and vlogs. If you enjoy seeing idols eating, you'll have plenty of bonus material to watch.
If you *don't* like seeing idols eat sticking to just music videos might be your best bet--there will be no trigger warnings for food.
