# Justice: Guide with spoilers!

Dreamcatcher are now heroes instead, out to seek to avenge the 100 victims.
In the beginning the choruses are gated, but once JiU breaks her bonds
and frees herself the distortion disappears.

Gahyun & Siyeon cooperate to destroy the crown.

At the end of the video we see an extra person. Dreamcatcher have not yet
confirmed who it is, though in their own reaction to the music video
JiU hinted that it is Shasha; another theory is that it is Guil,
whose secret diary Siyeon is reading at the beginning of the music video.
The third suspect would be JiU from the Deja Vu video;
this is mainly based on the looks of the character and the fact that
there are a lot of multiverse references during this era.
Finally, the fourth suspect is that the character represents InSomnia.

In OOTD they were singing about being flawless. In Justice they sing
"clean me up", knowing that they're flawed.

In OOTD Handong pushes Yoohyeon to the ground then helps her up,
showing that it's a fake fight. In Justice Yoohyeon helps Handong up,
without fourth wall breakage.
