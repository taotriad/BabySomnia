# Recommended watching for Dreamcatcher

## [1] A first peek (dipping your toes)

*Justification*: the reason to start with this video is that:

1. it's one of their most popular tracks
2. it is not connected to their other videos
3. it had a quite reasonable budget for the music video

*Prediction*: if you like this song you'll soon be an InSomnia. If not, well, there's still hope to win you over yet.

## [1] Your first storyline (in recommended viewing order)

*Justification*: The reason for picking this next is because it has English subtitles prefixed by the names of the members.  
*Prediction*: If you like rap you'll soon have a new favourite rapper (unless your favourite rapper is Moonbyul, in which case you'll now have two favourites instead of one).

## Interlude

Are you still with us? Like what you've been hearing so far?
Let's do a few B-sides that will give you a first glimpse of the real people behind the polished idol surface.

## [3] First batch of B-sides

**[3]** These two videos are a **must** even if you're only here because of random weird clips.
*Prediction*: If you enjoy these videos you're one of us.

* [Poison Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKXjvh-wYKY) *(Self-made MV)* [[H]](Poison_Love_hints.md)

If you did **not** enjoy these videos you're unlikely to enjoy their behind-the-scenes, vlogs, vlives, etc.

## [1] Back to A-sides (The Nightmare Era)

This is their longest story line. It's also their first. They're younger and have lower budget for the videos.
Chase Me and Good Night should ideally be watched back to back.

* **[X]** [The Curse of the Spider (2024 Concert Version)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUcuTIMTZq4) (B-side connected to the Nightmare era)

### Alternate versions

* **[4]** [Chase Me (Dance Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRW29bBK_oM) *(Chase Me is still regarded as one of their most demanding choreographies; several other companies have used it to test trainees.)*
* **[4]** [Good Night Dance Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-kCpiibFAg) *(The choreo, especially the intro, is fantastic)*
* **[4]** [Good Night Dance Practice)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceABfphGjUo) *(The dance practice video is probably better though, since it shows off the footwork in the intro)*

## **[1][6]** The History of Dreamcatcher

While it's not strictly necessary to know the full history of Dreamcatcher when doing reactions,
I'm recommending this video for two reasons:

1. The video is highly entertaining
2. I gives some insight into just how tough their journey has been

### Documentary video

## Interlude II

If you've made it here, and still enjoy yourself, consider yourself a BabySomnia!
As JiU once said, "Dreamcatcher is like a black hole. Once you go in you won't be able to get out."

## [1] Two More Stand-alone releases

Not all Dreamcatcher releases belong to story archs.
