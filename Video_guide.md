# Recommended watching for Dreamcatcher

## [1] A first peek (dipping your toes)

*Justification*: the reason to start with this video is that:

1. it's one of their most popular tracks
2. it is not connected to their other videos
3. it had a quite reasonable budget for the music video

*Prediction*: if you like this song you'll soon be an InSomnia. If not, well, there's still hope to win you over yet.

* [Deja Vu Unplugged Acoustics Version Utopia Crossroad Concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vLwdIeiw)

## [1] Your first storyline (The Dystopia Trilogy)

*Justification*: The reason for picking this next is because it has English subtitles prefixed by the names of the members.  
*Prediction*: If you like rap you'll soon have a new favourite rapper (unless your favourite rapper is Moonbyul, in which case you'll now have two favourites instead of one).

### Music videos

### Alternate versions

*Note*: While the part change video is listed here, it might be better to wait a bit and watch it once you've learned to
know a bit about the personalities and quirks of the members, since that shines through quite heavily in that video and is a large
part of what makes it so funny.

## Interlude

Are you still with us? Like what you've been hearing so far?
Let's do a few B-sides that will give you a first glimpse of the real people behind the polished idol surface.

## [3] First batch of B-sides

**[3]** These two videos are a **must** even if you're only here because of random weird clips.
*Prediction*: If you enjoy these videos you're one of us.

### Music videos

* [Sahara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgLhbkKu1s4) *(Self-made MV)* [[H]](Sahara_hints.md)
* [Poison Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKXjvh-wYKY) *(Self-made MV)* [[H]](Poison_Love_hints.md)

If you did **not** enjoy these videos you're unlikely to enjoy their behind-the-scenes, vlogs, vlives, etc.

## [1] Back to A-sides (The Nightmare Era)

This is their longest story line. It's also their first. They're younger and have lower budget for the videos.
Chase Me and Good Night should ideally be watched back to back.

### Music videos

* [Chase Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zihoyz0u_cs) *(Debut)* [[H]](Chase_Me_hints.md), [[S]](Chase_Me_spoilers.md)

* **[X]** [The Curse of the Spider (2024 Concert Version)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUcuTIMTZq4) (B-side connected to the Nightmare era)

### Alternate versions

* **[4]** [Chase Me (Dance Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRW29bBK_oM) *(Chase Me is still regarded as one of their most demanding choreographies; several other companies have used it to test trainees.)*
* **[4]** [Good Night Dance Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-kCpiibFAg) *(The choreo, especially the intro, is fantastic)*
* **[4]** [Good Night Dance Practice)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceABfphGjUo) *(The dance practice video is probably better though, since it shows off the footwork in the intro)*

## **[1][6]** The History of Dreamcatcher

While it's not strictly necessary to know the full history of Dreamcatcher when doing reactions,
I'm recommending this video for two reasons:

1. The video is highly entertaining
2. I gives some insight into just how tough their journey has been

### Documentary video

* [Dodging Disbandment and Other Extreme Sports: A History of Dreamcatcher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIgCAp3i1os)

## Interlude II

If you've made it here, and still enjoy yourself, consider yourself a BabySomnia!
As JiU once said, "Dreamcatcher is like a black hole. Once you go in you won't be able to get out."

## [1] Two More Stand-alone releases

Not all Dreamcatcher releases belong to story archs.

### Music videos

* [BEcause](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEKkdIT8JPM) [[H]](BEcause_hints.md), [[S]](BEcause_spoilers.md)

### Alternate versions

* **[4]** [BEcause Dance Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TG32s-ivmjY) *(I love the music video, but missing out on the choreography would be a bad mistake)*
* **[3][4]** [BEcause relay dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmWoGlrTPsA) *(This relay dance combines goofiness with crazy choreography; the only problem is knowing what to focus on; might trigger copyright strikes)*

## [1][6] The Apocalypse Trilogy

### Music videos

* [Reason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3fUZUh1LBs) [[H]](Reason_hints.md) *(Dreamcatcher's third fan-song released at Dreamcatcher's 6th anniversary; not part of the Apocalypse trilogy, but just trust me, this is where it belongs; be sure to watch with lyrics)*

* [Bon Voyage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPNaYj6etb8) [[H]](Bon_Voyage_hints.md)

### Alternate versions

* [Maison Show Champion Performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLgL6_C3Edo) *(Their Show Champion performance; likely to trigger copyright strikes)*
* **[3][4]** [Bon Voyage relay dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrK5OAL67oc) *(This relay dance combines goofiness with crazy choreography; the only problem is knowing what to focus on; might trigger copyright strikes)*

## [1] VersuS Duology

This is, as of writing, their most recent era. It's also by far the most lore heavy. The first part of the duology was released along with an Alternate Reality Game,
the second part of the duology was launched along with a Dreamcatcher escape room. Especially the first part of the duology can be a bit jarring compared to what you've experienced so far,
but when factoring in the lore (some of which is mentioned in the spoiler for OOTD) it all makes sense.

## Interlude III

Congratulations! You've journeyed your way through Dreamcatcher's title tracks + a few bonuses.
That said, you've only scratched the surface. Now it's time for It's time for some B-sides, covers, solos/subunits, etc.,
to get some depth.

## [1][2][6] Japanese releases

So, you are a rocker? Most of this section is for you! Dreamcatcher made a few attempts to get a break-through in the Japanese market.
They didn't have much luck, but at least it resulted in some great tracks.

### Music videos

* **[2]** [No More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HanFwe41w9s) *(Possibly their heaviest track; could be considered an honourary member of the Dystopia trilogy, since it deals with the same topic. Pontus Norgren, guitar player from HammerFall, helped compose the song)*
* **[2]** [Don't Light My Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVg7ELM1iZ4) *(Nice chugging guitars!)*
* **[2]** [Endless Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCALuFy2YVI)
* [Eclipse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9UxVkTfkVg) *(You know how everyone keeps saying that Dreamcatcher's title tracks sound like anime OST? Well, this one is the opening track from the anime adaptation of the game that Deja Vu was written for)*

## B-sides

By now they've published over 100 B-sides, so I'm only going to recommend a small subset, mainly songs that have interesting videos.

### Music videos

[5] If women in suits is your thing, both versions of Black or White are for you.

* [Jazz Bar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZoEESSF528)
* **[4]** [Red Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKBJVdjOHUY) *(SuA choreographed this video; the choreo is outright hypnotic, which is fitting since the song is about hypnotism)*
* [July 7th](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7u7vUzgtUlk)
* **[4]** [Sleepwalking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_GcbZlDnns) *(A really early Dreamcatcher song with a very low budget MV)*
* [Fireflies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJTk5TPBl9M) *(A true vocal showcase, with a massive overdose of harmonies. Insomnicsy, one of the most famous Dreamcatcher fan-content producers, made a MV for it; be prepared with tissues)*

* [Silent Night Live in Paris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtscFflDUMA) *(The sound quality is bad, the video quality is bad, but it's still awesome; this song is best heard live on location and you'll never know what choreo you'll get)*:
* **[3]** [Break the Wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqcPjwKU_zc) *(Self-made MV)* [[H]](Break_the_Wall_hints.md)

## Solos and Sub-units

Dreamcatcher only has one (semi-)official subunit; Yaja Time. Bong (SuA; maknae, vocals), Nibal (Siyeon, rapper, vocals), and Tafe (Yoohyeon; leader, vocals).
They have only done covers though; some which are included in the *Covers* section. Dami & Siyeon has made one O.S.T. together.

All members have made at least one solo, published on Dreamcatcher's album Apocalypse: Save Us. SuA, Siyeon, Handong, and Dami have separate solo releases.

*Note:* since Siyeon and Dami have published quite a lot more solo releases than the rest of the members I only included a representative subset.
