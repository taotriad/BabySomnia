# Recommended watching for Dreamcatcher

## [1] A first peek (dipping your toes)

*Justification*: the reason to start with this video is that:

1. it's one of their most popular tracks
2. it is not connected to their other videos
3. it had a quite reasonable budget for the music video

*Prediction*: if you like this video you'll soon be an InSomnia. If not, well, there's still hope to win you over yet.

### Music videos

* Deja Vu

### Alternate versions

* Deja Vu Unplugged Acoustics Version Utopia Crossroad Concert.

## [1] Your first storyline (in recommended viewing order)

*Justification*: The reason for picking this next is because it has English subtitles prefixed by the names of the members.  
*Prediction*: If you like rap you'll soon have a new favourite rapper (unless your favourite rapper is Moonbyul, in which case you'll now have two favourites instead of one).

### Music videos

* Scream *(Note: Handong is missing in this video, but represented by a dancer wearing a mask)*
* BOCA *(Note: Handong is missing in this video too)*
* Odd Eye

### Alternate versions

* [3][4] Zombie version
* [4] Choreo version
