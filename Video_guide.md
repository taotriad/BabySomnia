# Recommended watching for Dreamcatcher

## [1] A first peek (dipping your toes)

*Justification*: the reason to start with this video is that:

1. it's one of their most popular tracks
2. it is not connected to their other videos
3. it had a quite reasonable budget for the music video

*Prediction*: if you like this song you'll soon be an InSomnia. If not, well, there's still hope to win you over yet.

### Music videos

* [Deja Vu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W761DtH1oRg)

### Alternate versions

* [Deja Vu Unplugged Acoustics Version Utopia Crossroad Concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vLwdIeiw)

## [1] Your first storyline (in recommended viewing order)

*Justification*: The reason for picking this next is because it has English subtitles prefixed by the names of the members.  
*Prediction*: If you like rap you'll soon have a new favourite rapper (unless your favourite rapper is Moonbyul, in which case you'll now have two favourites instead of one).

## Interlude

Are you still with us? Like what you've been hearing so far?
Let's do a few B-sides that will give you a first glimpse of the real people behind the polished idol surface.

**[3]** These two videos are a **must** even if you're only here because of random weird clips.

*Prediction*: If you enjoy these videos you're one of us.

* [Sahara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgLhbkKu1s4) *(Self-made MV)* [H](Sahara_hints.md)
* [Poison Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKXjvh-wYKY) *(Self-made MV)* [H](Poison_Love_hints.md)

If you did **not** enjoy these videos you're unlikely to enjoy their behind-the-scenes, vlogs, vlives, etc.

## [1] Back to A-sides (The Nightmare Era)

This is their longest story line. It's also their first. They're younger and have lower budget for the videos.
Chase Me and Good Night should ideally be watched back to back.

### Alternate versions

* **[4]** [Chase Me (Dance Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRW29bBK_oM) *(Chase Me is still regarded as one of their most demanding choreographies; several other companies have used it to test trainees.)*
* **[4]** [Good Night Dance Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-kCpiibFAg) *(The choreo, especially the intro, is fantastic)*
* **[4]** [Good Night Dance Practice)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceABfphGjUo) *(The dance practice video is probably better though, since it shows off the footwork in the intro)*
