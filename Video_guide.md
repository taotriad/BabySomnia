# Recommended watching for Dreamcatcher

## [1] A first peek (dipping your toes)

*Justification*: the reason to start with this video is that:

1. it's one of their most popular tracks
2. it is not connected to their other videos
3. it had a quite reasonable budget for the music video

*Prediction*: if you like this video you'll soon be an InSomnia. If not, well, there's still hope to win you over yet.

### Music videos

* Deja Vu

### Alternate versions

* Deja Vu Unplugged Acoustics Version Utopia Crossroad Concert.

## [1] Your first storyline (in recommended viewing order)

*Justification*: The reason for picking this next is because it has English subtitles prefixed by the names of the members.  
*Prediction*: If you like rap you'll soon have a new favourite rapper (unless your favourite rapper is Moonbyul, in which case you'll now have two favourites instead of one).

Let's do a few B-sides that will give you a first glimpse of the real people behind the polished idol surface.

[3] These two videos are a **must** even if you're only here because of random weird clips.

*Prediction*: If you enjoy these videos you're one of us.

If you did **not** enjoy these videos you're unlikely to enjoy their behind-the-scenes, vlogs, vlives, etc.

## [1] Back to A-sides (The Nightmare Era)

This is their longest story line. It's also their first. They're younger, have lower budget for the videos,
