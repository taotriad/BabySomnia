# Recommended watching for Dreamcatcher

First of all, there's no need to slavishly follow the order in this guide.
But sticking to the order within each section is recommended, at least for the
sections that have "trilogy", "era", or "duology" in their names. Also, not
surprisingly any guides, interviews, behind the scenes, etc. may contain
spoilers.  So if you're doing reactions, either follow the order here, or stick
only to MVs + relay dances + choreography videos + showcases.

Second of all, if you came here because you have already watched some
Dreamcatcher video but felt confused by the video, it's probably best to find
the section that contains the video you saw, and start from the beginning in
that section (or simply read the hints/spoilers).

So for instance, if your introduction to Dreamcatcher happened to be BOCA (a
rather common thing), you'd go to the section containing the Dystopia trilogy
and watch Scream, BOCA (again, just to refresh your memory), then Odd Eye.
If you're still confused after that you can read the spoilers.

If you're **not** here because you want to react to Dreamcatcher, feel free to jump around
however you choose. In fact, if you don't mind song spoilers you might as well
start off by watching the documentary
**Dodging Disbandment and Other Extreme Sports**.

Also, remember: **[S]** stands for **Spoilers**, **[H]** for **Hints**.
The info in **[H]** is intended to be read before watching the video to help understand the video without spoiling anything important,
the info in **[S]** is intended to clarify things if you're still confused after watching the video.
An **[S]** before a video indicates that it spoils material that precedes it in the guide.

**NOTE**: Everything in the sections **Interviews**, **Chaoscatcher**, and **Insomnicsy** may contain spoilers.
Those videos will **NOT** have separate spoiler warnings.

## [1] Deja Vu: A first peek (dipping your toes)

*Justification*: the reason to start with this video is that:

1. It's one of their most popular tracks
2. It is not connected to their other videos
3. It had a quite reasonable budget for the music video

*Prediction*: if you like this song you'll soon be an InSomnia. If not, well, there's still hope to win you over yet.

## [1] Your first storyline (The Dystopia Trilogy)

*Justification*: The reason for picking this next is because it has English subtitles prefixed by the names of the members.  
*Prediction*: If you like rap you'll soon have a new favourite rapper (unless your favourite rapper is Moonbyul, in which case you'll now have two favourites instead of one).

*Note*: While the part change video is listed here, it might be better to wait a bit and watch it once you have learned to
know a bit about the personalities and quirks of the members, since that shines through quite heavily in that video and is a large
part of what makes it so funny.

## Interlude: Self-made MVs for awesome B-sides

Are you still with us? Like what you have been hearing so far?
Let's do a few B-sides that will give you a first glimpse of the real people behind the polished idol surface.

## [3] First batch of B-sides

**[3]** These two videos are a **must** even if you're only here because of random weird clips.  
*Prediction*: If you enjoy these videos you're one of us.

If you did **not** enjoy these videos you're unlikely to enjoy their behind-the-scenes, vlogs, vlives, etc.

## [1] Back to A-sides (The Nightmare Era)

This is their longest story line. It is also their first. They are younger and have lower budget for the videos.
Chase Me and Good Night should ideally be watched back to back.

## **[1][6]** The History of Dreamcatcher

While it's not strictly necessary to know the full history of Dreamcatcher when doing reactions,
this video is recommended for two reasons:

1. The video is highly entertaining
2. It gives some insight into just how tough their journey has been

## Interlude II: Minx

If you have made it here, and still enjoy yourself, consider yourself a BabySomnia!
As JiU once said, "Dreamcatcher is like a black hole. Once you go in you won't be able to get out."

You probably noticed that a group named Minx was mentioned in Dodging Disbandment (assuming you watched it)?
If you're interested this is probably the right opportunity to watch their debut and their only comeback.

## [1] VersuS Duology

This is, as of writing, their most recent era. It is also by far the most external lore heavy. The first part of the duology was released along with an Alternate Reality Game,
the second part of the duology was launched along with a Dreamcatcher escape room. Especially the first part of the duology can be a bit jarring compared to what you have experienced so far,
but when factoring in the lore (some of which is mentioned in the spoiler for OOTD) it all makes sense.

## Interlude III

Congratulations! You have journeyed your way through Dreamcatcher\'s title tracks + a few bonuses.
That said, you have only scratched the surface. Now it is time for some B-sides, covers, solos/subunits, etc.,
to get some depth.

## [1][2][6] Japanese releases

So, you are a rocker? Most of this section is for you! Dreamcatcher made a few attempts to get a break-through in the Japanese market.
They didn't have much luck, but at least it resulted in some great tracks.

### Music videos

* **[2]** [Don't Light My Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVg7ELM1iZ4) *(Nice chugging guitars!)*

* [Eclipse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9UxVkTfkVg) *(You know how everyone keeps saying that Dreamcatcher's title tracks sound like anime OST? Well, this one is the opening track from the anime adaptation of the game that Deja Vu was written for)*

## B-sides

By now they have published over 100 B-sides, so this is only a small subset, mainly songs that have interesting videos.

### Music videos

* **[3]** [Break the Wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqcPjwKU_zc) *(Self-made MV)* [[H]](Break_the_Wall_hints.md)

## [8] Solos and Sub-units

Dreamcatcher only has one (semi-)official subunit; Yaja Time. Bong (SuA; maknae, vocals), Nibal (Siyeon, rapper, vocals), and Tafe (Yoohyeon; leader, vocals).
They have only done covers though; some which are included in the *Covers* section. Dami and Siyeon have made one OST together.

All members have made at least one solo, published on Dreamcatcher's album Apocalypse: Save Us. SuA, Siyeon, Handong, and Dami have separate solo releases.

*Note:* since Siyeon and Dami have published quite a lot more solo releases than the rest of the members this list only includes a representative subset.

A lot of these are fancams or have bad audio for other reasons. But they're all worth watching for other reasons.

Their dancing might (except in the relay dances) seem razor sharp, their vocals and rap impeccable, and the acting in their music videos (except the self-made ones) professional,
but behind the scenes, or when they themselves write the scripts, oh boy, chaos galore, as you probably noticed from their self-made music videos and relay dances already.

Note: Insomnicsy's "This Is..." videos are intended to be entertaining first and foremost; don't take them too seriously.
That said, even with context included a lot of things just cannot be explained.

*Note:* Since more 2024-editions started dropping after the first batch was added here.
At least for the time being the new versions will be added, the old versions kept around,
but the screenshots will *not* be updated.

### Mukbang

![Dreamcatcher mukbang series ep 1: chicken](images/mukbang_chicken.g.png 'Dreamcatcher mukbang series ep 1: chicken')
![Dreamcatcher mukbang series ep 2: burger](images/mukbang_burger.g.png 'Dreamcatcher mukbang series ep 2: burger')

Dreamcatcher *loves* food, and unlike most companies Dreamcatcher Company (ex Happyface Entertainment) doesn't force them to starve.
Instead the policy is that it's better to stay fit by exercise and eating well.

Different members like different things. The queen of burgers is definitely Gahyun, Siyeon swears by tteokbokki,
Handong loves hotpot, everyone loves chicken, pork, and steak.

JiU's favourite food seems to be... Food. She's open to try pretty much everything.

Dami *hates* pineapple due to a traumatic experience, SuA hates coffee
(no trauma involved to the best of my knowledge), Handong loves chocolate but is allergic, Siyeon dislikes seafood.
Yoohyeon doesn't eat olives. Gahyun doesn't eat sweet potatoes, while Dami loves them.
Everyone loves noodles, but they all have different favourites...
