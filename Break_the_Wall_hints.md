# Break the Wall: Hints and details to look out for

The music video was completely filmed at the Dreamcatcher Company office.
Be sure to check out Dami in the scene where the members surround Gahyun.

## Notes

* Handong is missing in this video since it was recorded during the BOCA era.
* This music video was inspired by the "K-pop with Zero Budget!" series of videos.
* Sadly the music video completely lacks English subtitles.
