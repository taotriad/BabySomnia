# Poison Love: Hints and details to look out for

The music video was recorded entirely in their training room.

## Notes

* Handong is **definitely** back.
* This music video was inspired by the "K-pop with Zero Budget!" series of videos.
* Sadly the subtitles are only for the text-only bits of the music video; the lyrics are not translated, but the video is fully enjoyable anyway.
