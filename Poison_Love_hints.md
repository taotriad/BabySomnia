The music video was recorded entirely in their training room.

*Note*: Handong is **definitely** back.  
*Note*: This music video was inspired by the "K-pop with Zero Budget!" series of videos.  
*Note*: Sadly the subtitles are only for the text-only bits of the music video; the lyrics are not translated, but the video is fully enjoyable anyway.
