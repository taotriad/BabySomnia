# Chase Me: Guide with spoilers!

A paranormal investigator, hired to find and banish or trap
(the story line never really clarifies) a group of ghosts, arrives at the hotel.
The haunted room is room 808, but the door is locked, he cannot get in.
Instead the light flickers and he sees JiU at the end of the corridor.

While trying to film her, however, he quickly realises that she's not visible through the camera.

Since he cannot get into the room he wants he sets up his base of operations in another room instead.
At 0:53 in the video we can briefly see the letter he received from the hotel.
The hotel is named Hotel Garni, and his name seems to be O.L. de Rynck, from Brussels.

During the duration of the music video we see the ghost hunter
trying to find the girls, while they toy with him; haunting his dreams,
replacing all room signs with the same number, etc.
The investigator sets up multiple cameras to record what goes on at the hotel,
but the only thing he sees on the tape is himself fleeing from the ghosts that he can see,
but the camera cannot see.

Eventually he's had enough. Using an axe he forcibly makes his way into room 808.
When he finally gets into their room he realises that it's completely abandoned.

The video ends with a haunting melody from a music box playing, as the investigator
smirks crookedly.  He still finds what he needs, however (hence his crooked smile);
a photo of the girls.

*Note*: Their dance outfits are shortened versions of yukata.
Customarily when wearing a yukata the left side is always
wrapped over the right side. However, in this music video they wear the right side over the left.
Right to left closure is *only* worn by the deceased.
