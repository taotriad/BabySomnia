# Chase Me: Guide with spoilers!

An investigator arrives at a hotel. We quickly realise that he's
a paranormal investigator hired to find and banish or trap
(the story line never really clarifies) a group of ghosts, arrives at the hotel.
The haunted room is room 808, but the door is locked, he cannot get in.
Instead the light flickers and he sees JiU at the end of the corridor.

While trying to film her, however, he quickly realises that she's not visible through the camera.

Since he cannot get into the room he wants he sets up his base of operations in another room instead.
At 0:53 in the video we can briefly see the letter he received from the hotel.
The hotel is named Hotel Garni, and his name seems to be O.L. de Rynck, from Brussels.

During the duration of the music video we see the ghost hunter
trying to find the girls, while they toy with him; haunting his dreams,
replacing all room signs with the same number, etc.
The investigator sets up multiple cameras to record what goes on at the hotel,
but the only thing he sees on the tape is himself fleeing from the ghosts that he can see,
but the camera cannot see.

Eventually he's had enough. Using an axe he forcibly makes his way into room 808.
When he finally gets into their room he realises that it's completely abandoned.

The video ends with a haunting melody from a music box playing, as the investigator
smirks crookedly.  He still finds what he needs, however (hence his crooked smile);
a photo of the girls.

* [Still Life-Infinite Vanitas (Photo)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kevsyd/5566316575) ([Kevin Best](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kevsyd/)); on the rear wall to the left in the room where they dance the main choreography.
* [Vanitas](https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-van-hemessen/vanit) ([Jan Sanders van Hemessen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Sanders_van_Hemessen)); on the left wall in the room where they dance the main choreography, directly over the door.
* [Vanitas - Still Life with Books and Manuscripts and a Skull](https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/vanitas-still-life-with-books-and-manuscripts-and-a-skull/DwF8UvX5vRxoAw) (Edwaert Collier); a cropped version of this artwork is at the rear of the hotel corridor behind JiU. This artwork is also used closest to the camera on the left wall in the room where they dance the main choreography.
* [Vanitas](https://prints.denverartmuseum.org/detail/506935/collier-a-vanitas-1669) (Edwaert Collier); in the hotel corridor on the left wall opposite the door to room 808.

### Unidentified artworks

* The artwork on the left wall between Pier Francesco Cittadini and Edwaert Collier in the room where they dance the main choreography.
* The artwork on the left wall closest to the left of the door in the hotel corridor / in the center of the rear wall in the investigator's bedroom.
* The artwork on the right wall in the hotel corridor.

**Help**: If you can identify any of these paintings, please provide name + artist.


### Note on choice of artworks

These artworks represent the certainty of death and the brevity of life.

## Books

* Jan le Boër ([Constant Améro (Fr)](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_Am%C3%A9ro)); next to Dami when she's laying on the floor
* Never Goin' Back: Winning the Weight Loss Battle For Good ([Al Roker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Roker)); pushed to the floor by Gahyun
* Retreat, Hell! ([W.E.B. Griffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._E._B._Griffin)); pushed to the floor by Gahyun

### Note on choice of literature

The subtitle of Never Goin' Back is not included on the spine,
so that book was probably included for it's title.
Retreat, Hell! is a book about the Korean war, so it has a connection
to Korea, but it, too, was probably picked for its title.
Jan le Boër, on the other hand, is trickier to explain. Maybe just because of the beautiful cover?

## Notes

* Their dance outfits are shortened versions of yukata.
  Customarily when wearing a yukata the left side is always
  wrapped over the right side. However, in this music video they wear the right side over the left.
  Right to left closure is *only* worn by the deceased.
* The room number *808* could either be a reference to the police code for "Disturbing the peace",
  or the famous Roland TR-808 Drum Machine.
