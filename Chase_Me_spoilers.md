# Chase Me: Guide with spoilers!

A ghost hunter, hired to find and banish or trap (the story line never really
clarifies) a group of ghosts, arrives at a hotel and immediately notices
the girls who haunt the hotel. While trying to document his findings,
however, he quickly realises that they're not visible on camera (quite the opposite
of standard horror tropes).

The entire music video is him hunting the girls, the girls toying with him,
haunting his dreams, replacing all room signs with the same number, etc.
When he finally finds their room he realises that it's completely abandoned.

He still finds what he needs, however (hence his crooked smile); a photo of the girls.
