# R.o.S.E. BLUE: Guide with spoilers!

The story takes place in an alternate world where SuA, Siyeon, Yoohyeon, Dami, and Gahyun are trapped in their nightmares.

JiU must venture into their nightmares and kill their tormented selves to set them free and allow them to wake up.

The 5 members are thought to represent the five stages of grief:

* Denial (Yoohyeon)
* Anger (SuA)
* Bargaining (Dami)
* Depression (Siyeon)
* Acceptance (Gahyun)

The reason that Gahyun looks so trusting and happy when she sees JiU, while JiU looks so sad,
is that in-game JiU and Gahyun are sisters.

Once JiU has liberated all five members they return to the real world. But JiU's gun is empty
and she is stuck in the alternate world.

Some fans speculate that SuA was raging because she knew that JiU didn't have enough bullets.
