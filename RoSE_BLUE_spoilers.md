# R.o.S.E. BLUE: Guide with spoilers!

The story takes place in an alternate world where SuA, Siyeon, Yoohyeon, Dami, and Gahyun are trapped in their nightmares.

JiU must venture into their nightmares and kill their tormented selves to set them free and allow them to wake up.

The 5 members are thought to represent the five stages of grief:

* Denial (Yoohyeon)
* Anger (SuA)
* Bargaining (Dami)
* Depression (Siyeon)
* Acceptance (Gahyun)

The reason that Gahyun looks so trusting and happy when she sees JiU, while JiU looks so sad,
is that in-game JiU and Gahyun are sisters. The version of that scene
from the [making of R.o.S.E. BLUE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-BRVrx7asg&t=237s) video is
even sadder. Maybe they thought people would be traumatised seeing that version and decided not to include it?

Once JiU has liberated all five members they return to the real world. But JiU's gun is empty
and she is stuck in the alternate world.

Some fans speculate that SuA was raging because she knew that JiU didn't have enough bullets.

*Note*: Since Handong couldn't participate in the video she instead made [her own reaction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-qxVhFq0Rw).
