# Chase Me: Hints and details to look out for

*Note*: In the original recording of Chase Me, Handong's first verse is actually recorded by Siyeon (in the MV Handong is shown as singing it though).
In later performances, as well as the Japanese version, Handong is performing it herself though. The group has never confirmed if it was changed
because she didn't have enough lines in the song and thus got one of Siyeon's lines, or if it was her line to begin with but felt too insecure about
her Korean and didn't feel confident to record it.
