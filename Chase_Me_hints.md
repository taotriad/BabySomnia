## Notes
* In the original recording of Chase Me, Handong's first verse is actually recorded by Siyeon (in the MV Handong is shown as singing it though).
  In live performances, as well as the Japanese version, Handong performs it herself. The group has never confirmed if it was changed
  because she didn't have enough lines in the song and thus got one of Siyeon's lines, or if it was her line to begin with but felt too insecure about
  her Korean and didn't feel confident to record it.
