# Justice dancEAR: Hints and details to look out for

**Listen with headphones!**

This version of Justice features spatial audio, live singing, unfiltered vocals and full choreography.
You can hear the choreo affect their singing.  You can hear the sound of their boots stomping,
the whooshing of the pyrotechnics. To fully drive home the message
that "Yes, we sing this well live while doing choreo; this isn't prerecorded", check what Dami does with her microphone
during her rap just as it reaches "My vital rhythm", and behold her smirk. Show, don't tell.
