# OOTD: Guide with spoilers!

OOTD is about narcissism and the superficiality of the K-pop and fashion industries, and the influencer culture,
and how it corrupts people.  In the music video Dreamcatcher become villains (hence the album title VersuS: VillainS).

Fame is symbolised by "The Crown", which requires sacrifice; according to the messages from "ymenehcra" (Archenemy backwards)
actual human sacrifice; 100 victims to be precise, with Shasha, their assistant who is editing content in the beginning
of the music video, being one of those.

Details indicating that things aren't as they should be:

* The staged fight between Handong and Yoohyeon, where Handong breaks the fourth wall by helping Yoohyeon up
* Dami singing that she's drunk-driving every day (Dami never drinks alcohol), also drops the F* bomb
* Lyrics containing "look at my necklace" (when not wearing one) and "my black dress" (when not wearing a dress)
* Retouching photos
* A visible green screen, indicating that everything is fake
* Singing "I'm flawless, I'm spotless" while Handong's legs are covered in bruises
* They're also singing about being Nephtys; she's an Egyptian goddess associated with death (but as with all Egyptian deities also has overlapping positive associations)
* Everything is very meta; we can constantly see lighting rigs, cameras, boom arms, stages, crew members,

Oh, also at the end of the video we see Shasha collapse.
