# OOTD: Guide with spoilers!

OOTD is about narcissism and the superficiality of the K-pop and fashion industries, and the influencer culture.
In the music video Dreamcatcher become villains (hence the album title VersuS: VillainS).

Fame is symbolised by "The Crown", which requires sacrifice; according to the messages from "ymenehcra" (Archenemy backwards)
actual human sacrifice; 100 victims to be precise, with Shasha, their assistant who is editing content in the beginning
of the music video, being one of those.

Details indicating that things aren't as they should be:

* The staged fight between Handong and Yoohyeon
* Dami singing that she's drunk-driving every day (Dami never drinks alcohol)
* Lyrics containing "look at my necklace" (when not wearing one) and "my black dress" (when not wearing a dress)
* Retouching photos
* A visible green screen
