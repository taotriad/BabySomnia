# Why Did You Come to My Home?: Hints and details to look out for

This was Minx' debut single. Siyeon has a crazy high note at the end of the song,
and she also performed it live on the debut stage.

This song was released shortly before Siyeon's birthday. This means that 3 out of 5 members
were underage (by Korean standards) when it released; Dami and Yoohyeon were merely 17,
Siyeon just about to turn 19.

There are things that are things that are questionable both about the camera work
and their outfits when factoring in that they were dealing with underage persons.

This song didn't even get a physical release, so even though it was actually fairly
well received it was not a commercial success.

Anyhow, a lot of band debuted or released successful albums right about the same time,
so a band from a small company simply couldn't compete.

*Note:* This song is based on [Why Did You Come to My Home? (Korean Nursery Rhyme)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYzGzWRr9Eg)
