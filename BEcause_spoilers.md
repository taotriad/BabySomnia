# BEcause: Guide with spoilers!

The music video for BEcause is based on the movie Us by Jordan Peele,
where doppelgangers replace people. This is represented by the members
being snatched away, mirrored scenes, the same choreography mirrored with
different colours, etc.

Gahyun's "with your angelic face" definitely sounds like
FÃ¼r Elise (Bagatelle in A minor) by Ludwig van Beethoven,
and during Dami's rap there's a distinct audio nod to Psycho.

The music talks about obsessive love that eventually leads to
the obsessed person murdering their beloved for not following their rules.
