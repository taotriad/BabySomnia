# Sahara: Hints and details to look out for

The music video for Sahara was recorded while promoting Scream;
the entire video is shot in their waiting room and in the hallways around it.
Among other things the video features the famous "K-pop staircase" at KBS Open Hall
where Music Bank is recorded.

*Note*: Handong is missing in this video since it was recorded during the Scream era.  
**Important**: Make sure that you're watching with subtitles and that you follow both what
happens on-screen and the subtitles. They correlate *very* closely.
