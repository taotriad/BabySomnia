# Sahara: Hints and details to look out for

The music video for Sahara was recorded while promoting Scream;
the entire video is shot in their waiting rooms and the hallways around them.
Among other things the video features the famous "K-pop staircase" at KBS Open Hall
where Music Bank is recorded.

**Important**: Make sure that you're watching with subtitles and that you follow both what
