  SuA got bored during the Covid-19 lockdown and recruited Siyeon. Initially the plan was that just the two of them would play all roles (Gahyun would act as camera person),
  but the other members soon wanted roles. Siyeon plays 4 roles (including one scene where she slaps herself), JiU plays Gahyun's baby, etc.
  They also recorded a soundtrack that's utterly magnificent.
