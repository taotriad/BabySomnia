* **Mongmongie**: Dreamcatcher's lightstick; it is certified to be the
  longest lightstick in K-pop since it's extensible with extra segments
  that can be bought separately (two extra segments are included with
  the lightstick). Mongmongie with extensions evokes the feeling of
  a Wizard's staff. It also has a replacement head for the lightstick
  that makes it look more like a spear. It used to be programmable using
  an app, but the app no longer works with newer versions of Android.

* **The World of Dreamcatcher**: Dreamcatcher's interpretation of the
  K-drama The World of the Married. SuA got bored during the Covid-19
  lockdown and recruited Siyeon. Initially the plan was that just the
  two of them would play all roles (Gahyun would act as camera person),
  but the other members soon wanted roles. Siyeon plays 4 roles
  (including one scene where she slaps herself), JiU plays Gahyun's
  baby, etc. They also recorded a soundtrack that's utterly magnificent.
