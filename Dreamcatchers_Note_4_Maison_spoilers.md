# Maison: Guide with spoilers!

Well, not much of a guide, really. This is the episode of Dreamcatcher's Note that covers
their performance of Maison at Show Champion.

The timestamp in the URL points to when they're waiting for the announcement of the winner.
They can be heard talking along the lines of:

**Dami**: Maybe they left us for the content what we did, recorded just before the broadcast.  
**Yoohyeon**: Then say bye-bye.  
**Siyeon**: (gesturing countdown t-1)  
**SuA**: Who will be?  
**Dongie**: It's probably not...

[Maison starts playing]

**SuA**: How?

You can really see from JiU's expression that she was pretty certain though.

No other girl group had gone that long before getting a win; at this point they would've gotten
disbanded. One group (*Weki Meki*) actually survived longer than that,
[but they got disbanded without ever getting a win.](https://www.koreaboo.com/news/weki-meki-final-comeback-before-disbandment-leaves-many-disappointed/).

Anyhow, back to Dreamcatcher.

Every single comeback so far, every New Year's wish, every interview when they were asked what they were hoping for,
they inevitably always answered that their wish was to get a show win.

But this time it was different. When InSomnias asked before the promotions for Maison started,
they just answered that they hoped that the fans would like the song and other non-committal answers;
at this point it was clear that they had given up hope on ever winning a show.
They knew that they were loved by their fans, they knew that their sales were good,
they knew that their concerts attracted audiences, but by then they had also realised being loved
by their fans was not enough to get a win.

**1923** days of waiting for the Dreamcatcher members.
**2771** days of waiting for the Minx members.

Less than a week after the win at Show Champion they got their second win.
At The Show. Their nemesis. Vindication. Their win margin? 14 points...
Kind of Deja Vu vibes here, eh? (If you don't get the reference it's time to watch Dodging Disbandment...)
