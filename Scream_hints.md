## Notes

* Handong is missing in this video, due to participating in [Youth With You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_With_You_season_2),
  a Chinese talent show; due to this she got stuck in Wuhan once Covid-19 travel restrictions were introduced.
* In choreography scenes one dancer wears mask; that dancer represents Handong.
* The female backup dancers were members of Happyface Entertainment's pre-debut girl group [Happyface Girls](https://kpop.fandom.com/wiki/Happyface_Girls).
