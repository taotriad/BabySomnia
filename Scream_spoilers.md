# Scream: Guide with spoilers!

At first The Tree of Language is pure, enabling people to connect, increasing understanding.
But as time goes by the tree gets corrupted. Slowly it start dying.

Haters realise that they can remain behind the mask (hide behind the anonymity that the Internet).
They start ostracizing people; the video represents this as a witch trial.

Dami raps, "Forget everything you've seen, believe that nothing ever happened";
people just pretend that they haven't witnessed the bullying.

Dami continues "And one by one everyone becomes crazy".

After this Siyeon sings "I just wanna make you scream". The victims have been driven so far
that they, too, become haters.
