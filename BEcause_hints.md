# BEcause: Hints and details to look out for

There's little point trying to connect the lyrics with the music video.

BE represents 悲 (hanja for sadness), hence BEcause gives "the cause of sadness",
which in the context of the lyrics is "the cause of sadness is [that] I love you".

## Notes

* Enjoy JiU and (especially) Gahyun's facial expressions in this music video.
* The abandoned amusement park used for the music video is [Yongma Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yongma_Land) in Jungnang District, Seoul.
  The park has been used in [multiple other K-pop videos](https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamcatcher/comments/p0t5dt/yongma_land_kpop_idols/).
* This is Dreamcatcher's interpretation of summer song. Normally summer songs from Kpop bands
  deal with water, sun, dancing, etc. But this is Dreamcatcher we're talking about.
  In South Korea it's traditional to tell horror stories during summer, since getting the chills
  is supposed to help cool you down when it's hot weather.
  What could possibly make for a better summer song than a horror story?
* The amusement park that the music video is set in contains a ride called Disco Pang Pang;
  in one scene Handong is seen standing in the middle of it.
  There's some irony here; early in Dreamcatcher's career (2018?) they got to
  go to an amusement park (not the abandoned park in the MV, obviously),
  where Yoohyeon decided that they should try the Disco Pang Pang.
  Handong *really* hated that experience.
