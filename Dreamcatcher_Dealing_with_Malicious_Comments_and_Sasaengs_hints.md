# Dreamcatcher Dealing with Malicious Comments and Sasaengs: Hints and details to look out for

The clip with JiU, SuA, Siyeon, Yoohyeon, and Gahyun responding to hateful comments are from
[this vlive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxH7Jo8wyE&t=1205s). The English subtitles in this vlive
are watered down though.

Anyway, some background story: this vlive came out shortly after BOCA, a song about cyber-bullying
(as part of an entire trilogy about cyber-bullying).

It's obvious that a lot of people didn't listen to the lyrics, didn't understand the lyrics,
or just out ignored the lyrics. Gahyun has received a lot of hateful messages in the comments
during her vlives over the years. Here she tells the others about it, and Siyeon does **NOT** put
up with that shit.
