# A brief history of Minx

Before Dreamcatcher there was Minx. Minx was a 5-member group, formed in
2014, consisting of:

* JiU (leader, lead vocalist, lead dancer)
* SuA (vocalist, lead rapper, main dancer)
* Siyeon (main vocalist)
* Yoohyeon (lead vocalist)
* Dami (maknae, main rapper)

Minx' concept was cute.

History:
* 2014-08-09: First performance at Oak Valley Summertime Festival.
* 2014-09-15: Group officially announced as Minx.
* 2014-09-18: Why Did You Come to My Home? (digital single only) (**debut**)
* 2015-07-02: Love Shake (mini album; a cover of a B-side from Dal★Shabet) (**first—and only—comeback**)
* 2016-11-29: Officially announced that Minx would disband and re-debut as Dreamcatcher with 2 additional members (Handong and Gahyun).

The Minx era and its aftermath was stressful for the members. Siyeon
didn't like the genre and had originally considered a career as a solo
artist, Dami wasn't comfortable with the role as maknae nor the way they
dressed her, and SuA hated her hairstyle.

That might still have been acceptable if it weren't for the 9 months
wait between their debut and their first comeback (which was enough for
the members to start questioning the comeback) and the long wait another
comeback that never came. All of the members suffered to some degree;
Siyeon took it worst; she's said in interviews that she often cried
herself to sleep, refused to watch music shows, and spent her time
sneaking out to Internet cafés together with Yoohyeon to take her mind
off of music, since she was convinced that her career was over.
