# A brief history of Minx

Before Dreamcatcher there was Minx. Minx was a 5-member group,
formed in 2014, consisting of:

* **JiU** (leader, lead vocalist, lead dancer)
* **SuA** (vocalist, lead rapper, main dancer)
* **Siyeon** (main vocalist)
* **Yoohyeon** (lead vocalist)
* **Dami** (maknae, main rapper)

Minx' concept was cute.

* 2016-11-29: Officially announced that Minx would disband and re-debut as Dreamcatcher with 2 additional members (Handong and Gahyun).

The Minx era was stressful for some of the members. Siyeon
didn't like the genre and had originally considered a career as a solo
artist, Dami wasn't comfortable with the way they dressed her in the music videos,
and SuA hated her hairstyle.

That might still have been acceptable if it weren't for the 9 months
wait between their debut and their first comeback (which was enough for
the members to start questioning the comeback) and the long wait for another
comeback that never came. All of the members suffered to some degree.

Siyeon took it worst; she's said in interviews that she often cried
herself to sleep, refused to watch music shows, and spent her time
sneaking out to Internet cafés together with Yoohyeon to take her mind
off of music, since she was convinced that her career was over.

That's not to say that they didn't enjoy their time together as Minx though.
JiU still to this day loves the Minx music and the others have mostly come
to terms with that past.

The redebut as Dreamcatcher wasn't without stress either. Having two new
members joining, changing genre to something they knew wasn't popular in South Korea,
changing stylists, producers, everything all at once. JiU was worried because
she didn't think her voice would be suitable for rock music. She also really
liked the Minx music and wondered why they couldn't just get more Minx comebacks instead.
