# Fly High: Guide with spoilers!

This video takes place before Chase Me; this is where everything begins.
The girls are studying at a boarding school. While it's not filmed at the same location,
it's intended to represent the same building as in Chase Me and Good Night; in those
MVs the boarding school has been converted into a hotel.

The events are a bit out of order. Yoohyeon gets possessed by evil when she touches
the mirror in the meadow.  JiU captures a spider. When Yoohyeon finds the spider she,
driven by the darkness, kills the spider, causing them to be cursed by the spider queen.

One by one the girls gets possessed by evil. We see this represented as duplicate
versions of the girls. It's been speculated that SuA was the first to be possessed
and that she is the one that goes around to trap the rest.

At the end we see JiU close the gates. There are (at least) two interpretations of this:
Either that it's the good JiU who does it to protect the outside world,
the other is that the evil JiU who does it to prevent the others from escaping.

Fly High isn't composed by Leez / Ollounder. It's been speculated that this was
to make it clear that Fly High starts before they turn into nightmares.
