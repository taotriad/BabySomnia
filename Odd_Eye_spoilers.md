# Odd Eye: Guide with spoilers!

Having different colours for the left and right eye (heterochromia),
odd eyes, has supernatural connotations in some cultures.

In some Native American cultures heterochromia is referred to as
"Ghost Eyes" and means that the person can see heaven and earth
at the same time.

In some Eastern European cultures pagans heterochromia was referred to
as "Witch Eyes".

The odd eye supposedly helps you see through lies;
the falsehoods that are far too abundant online.

The chair that Yoohyeon is sitting in at the beginning of the video is
a mask; we're connecting back to Scream where people hid behind masks.

In the video several of the members are depicted as being controlled by,
obsessed by, or addicted to their phones, their computers, TV screens, etc.
SuA is crying text, Gahyun's face has emojis on it.

The starting position of the choreography is in the shape of an eye.

Two alternate interpretation exists of the beverage Yoohyeon drunks;
either that it represents the red pill (from The Matrix) which enables you
you to see the real truth. The other is that it's Kool-Aid.

Quoting Wikipedia:

>"Drinking the Kool-Aid" is strongly believing in and accepting a deadly, deranged, or foolish ideology or concept based only upon the overpowering coaxing of another; the expression is also used to refer to a person who wrongly has faith in a possibly doomed or dangerous idea because of perceived potential high rewards. [...]"

This is named after over 900 members of the Peoples Temple cult
committed suicide by drinking cyanide-spiked Flavor Aid (but reported
as Kool-Aid by media).

Whichever interpretation is true is hard to discern. On the one hand it
looks as though she immediately turns ill, which would support the Kool-Aid
interpretation, but the scene immediately afterwards is someone opening their
eyes, which would support the interpretation that they can see the real truth.
Both interpretations fit the concept though, so perhaps it's irrelevant
which one you end up with.

The tree of language is now completely corrupted.
We can no longer trust what we see and hear on the Internet.

According to an interview with JiU there is no utopia to find out in the world;
we must look within ourselves to find it.
