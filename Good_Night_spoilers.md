# Good Night: Guide with spoilers!

The ghost hunter, aided by pictures of the girls as well as a tome of spells,
manages to trap Gahyun and SuA, while Siyeon & Yoohyeon escape into the forest.
Dami, JiU, and Handong steal the tome and set fire to the page with the spell
that was used to ensnare SuA, thus freeing her. At the end of the video they trap
the ghost hunter in a mirror dimension.
