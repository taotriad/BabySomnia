# Good Night: Guide with spoilers!

The video starts with the motif from the music box that **Chase Me** ended with.

The paranormal investigator, aided by pictures of the girls as well as a tome of spells,
manages to trap Gahyun and SuA in their own nightmares.

JiU, Handong, and Dami are plotting against him. Handong uses her own nightmare
(fear of being observed) against him; she projects her fear onto him,
as can be observed in the scene where the walls are covered with eyes.

While the investigator is distracted, Dami reaches through the mirror on the desk
and grabs the spell tome.

JiU, Handong, and Dami set fire to the page with the spell that ensnares SuA.
We never see how they free Gahyun, but presumably they use the same method.
Finally reunited they trap the investigator in the same realm that they were
once trapped in.

As the video ends we see them escape into the forest, wearing capes.
During their escape they drop the spell tome.

## Notes

* The video features SuA being restrained. Being restrained is SuA's nightmare.
* The video features Handong staring at the investigator. Being stared at
  is Handong's nightmare. She's using her fear as a weapon.
* The video features Gahyun falling. Fear of falling is Gahyun's nightmare.
* The video features Yoohyeon running around in the forest, possibly lost.
  Fear of being lost is Yoohyeon's nightmare.
* The capes that the girls are wearing in the forest were later released
  as "Dreamcatcher Official Robe ver. 1" on Dreamcatcher's official store.
  Sadly both sizes of the robes are sold out.
