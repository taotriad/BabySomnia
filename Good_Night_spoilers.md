# Good Night: Guide with spoilers!

The video starts with the motif from the music box that **Chase Me** ended with.

The paranormal investigator, aided by pictures of the girls as well as a tome of spells,
manages to trap Gahyun and SuA in their own nightmares; SuA's nightmare is
fear of being constrained, while Gahyun's nightmare is fear of falling.

JiU, Handong, and Dami are plotting against him. Handong uses her own nightmare,
(fear of being observed) against him; she projects her fear onto him,
as can be observed in the scene when the walls are covered with eyes.

While the investigator is distracted, Dami reaches through the mirror on the desk
and grabs the spell tome.

JiU, Handong, and Dami set fire to the page with the spell that ensnares SuA.
We never see how they free Gahyun, but presumably they use the same method.
Finally reunited they trap the investigator in the same realm that they were
once trapped in.

As the video ends we see them escape into the forest, wearing capes.
During their escape the drop the spell tome.

## Notes

* The capes that the girls are wearing in the forest were later released
  as "Dreamcatcher Official Robe ver. 1" on Dreamcatcher's official store.
  Sadly both sizes of the robes are sold out.
