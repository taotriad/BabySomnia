# Justice: Hints and details to look out for

The artworks in the video are:

* Hero and Leander (Salvator Rosa)--Greek mythology
* Hero (Edward Burne-Jones)--Also based on the same mythology as Hero and Leander
* Valkyrie and a Dying Hero (Hans Makart)--Norse mythology
* Justice (Kenyon Cox)

A lot of religious imagery, obviously, but considering the choice of artworks I think it's reasonable to say
that the attempts by some to try to paint it as a Judeo-Christian allegory of Judgment day is wishful thinking
on behalf of Christians...

One important item in this video references back to the music video for OOTD. Can you remember?
