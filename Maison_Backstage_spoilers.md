# Maison: Guide with spoilers!

Well, not much of a guide, really. This video was taken backstage where Dreamcatcher
was waiting for the announcement of the winner. They can be heard talking along the lines of:

Dami: Maybe they left us for the content what we did, recorded just before the broadcast.
Yoohyeon: Then say bye-bye.
Siyeon: (gesturing countdown t-1)
SuA: Who will be?
Dongie: It's probably not...

[Maison starts playing]

SuA: How?

You can really see from JiU's expression that she was pretty certain though.

No other girl group had gone that long before getting a win; at this point they would've gotten
disbanded. One group (*Weki Meki*) actually survived longer than that without a win, but they got disbanded
without ever getting a win. The story about Weki Meki's disbandment is definitely worth reading about;
basically they released their last single *and* announced their disbandment on the same day).

Anyhow, back to Dreamcatcher.

Every single comeback so far, every new year's wish, every interview when they'd been asked what they are hoping for,
and inevitably they'd always answered that their wish was to get a show win.

But this time it was different. When InSomnias asked before the promotions for Maison started,
they just answered that they hoped that the fans would like the song and other non-committal answers;
at this point it was clear that they'd given up hope on ever winning a show. They knew that they were loved by their fans,
they knew that their sales were good, they knew that their concerts attracted audiences,
but by then they'd also realised being loved by their fans wasn't enough to get a win.

1923 days of waiting for the Dreamcatcher members.
2771 days of waiting for the Minx members.

Less than a week after the win at Show Champion they got their second win.
At The Show. Their nemesis. Vindication.
